# Events

An event is an occurence at a particular time, of which you may want to be notified. A number of events happen during the lifetime of a Bolt application. Examples include when a user logs into the system, when an app is started, when a new role is created, or when the system is shutting down. To get notifications about an event, you subscribe to \(or listen for\) that event. Also interesting is the fact that any app can raise its own events \(not just Bolt\). We will discuss both how to listen for events and how to raise your own events.

You listen for events by creating [hooks](/hooks.md).how to listen for an event, including the schema of the object u receive
