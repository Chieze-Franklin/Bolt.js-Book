# Installing the App

Let's get back to the _My Notebook_ app we are dealing with.

Here is what your _package.json_ file should look like:

```
{
    "name": "notes",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Note-Keeping App"
}
```

Now, create a new file named bolt-server.js. This is the file Bolt will run.

Your server.js should simply import the bolt-server.js, as shown below:

navigate to /install

start the app by /apps/notes \("notes" being the name of the app, as specified in the package.json\)
