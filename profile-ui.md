# Profile \(UI\)

This is a description of the UI endpoints exposed by the Bolt server for interacting with users' profiles.

The following endpoints are described here:

* [GET: /\*&lt;name&gt;](#get-name)

## GET: /\*&lt;name&gt;

This displays the profile of the user with the specified username. If the specified username is that of the logged-in user, the page will have editable controls, allowing the user to change their profile pictures, display names, passwords, email addresses, phone numbers.
