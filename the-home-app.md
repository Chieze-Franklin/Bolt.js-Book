# The Home App

talk about adding `{{root}}` to ur UI, then

if\(process.env.BOLT\_CHILD\_PROC \|\| app.get\("no\_bolt"\)\) root = ""; else root = process.env.BOLT\_ADDRESS + '/x/' + appname

encourage ppl to put the "main" tag in their app if they want it to show up on bolt-home

bolt-home doesnt show modules \(module=true\)
