# The Setup View

When ever you attempt to log into Bolt, a check is made to see if there is any registered user in the database. If there is no registered user Bolt assumes this is a fresh install, and proceeds to register you as a system administrator. To do this Bolt displays the _setup_ view. In addition to allowing you to register as an administrator, the _setup_ view also allows you to perform some other setup actions \(like installing needed apps, creating needed roles,...\), as defined in [setup.json](/setting-up-bolt/setup.json.md).

talk about native views \(with link to Reference/Views\)...some native views cannot be overriden by apps

talk about setup.json \(with link package.json/setup\) and how it installs things we need, include UI things

talk about some endpoints it calls \(with links to those Bolt Server Endpoints/endpoints\)
