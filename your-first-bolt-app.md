# Your First Bolt App

The next few pages will guide you through the development of your first Bolt app. 

The complete source code for the app you will be working on can be found at  [https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-in-action\/chapter3](https://github.com/ionic-in-action/chapter3). You can go ahead and download\/clone the project. Truth be told, you won't be _developing_ any app in this section, as the app has already been developed. The main objective here is to show you how easy it is to integrate an existing app into Bolt.
